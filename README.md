# Trivia-Tree

Trivia Tree provides a service for people to test their knowledge on an endless variety of different 
subjects through quizzes. Users can also create their own quizzes to test other users on the website, 
contributing to the growing collection of trivia for all types of topics. More importantly, users can 
create platforms which are customizable pages used to present quizzes they generate relating to a specific topic.

Trivia Tree differs from other quizzing sites by providing user leaderboards, a reward system for good performance, 
platform customization, and allowing users to see their relative performance compared to  other quiztakers. It also 
offers a simple to use, modernized user interface. Additionally, organizations, influencers, and users that are popular 
among the community will have the distinction of being verified by the site.

### [Leaderboards/Ratings/Recommendations]
Users will be placed onto leaderboards based on their performance on individual quizzes and specific platforms. Users can view the leaderboards
to see where they rank compared to other quiz takers. Users will be able to rate and review the quizzes they take and provide feedback which will be
used to figure out which quizzes will appear on the home page (most popular quizzes, best rated, etc.). After finishing a quiz, users will be recommended 
quizzes based on user data as well as the quiz that they just finished.
